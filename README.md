#  Cupcake Corner

This app is a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Add Codable conformance for @Published properties
- Send and receive Codable data with URLSession and SwiftUI
- Validate and disable forms

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
